# Secure GitHub Push Instructions

For security reasons, you should never share your GitHub token publicly or include it in commands that get stored in your terminal history.

## Option 1: Use GitHub CLI (Recommended)

1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Authenticate with: `gh auth login`
3. Push your repository: `gh repo create SulaimanConain/yn-analytics --source=. --push`

## Option 2: Use HTTPS with credential manager

1. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. When prompted, enter your GitHub username
3. For the password, use the personal access token (not your regular GitHub password)

## Option 3: Setup credential helper (recommended for long-term)

1. Configure Git to store credentials:
   ```
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
2. Push once using your token (it will be stored securely):
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Future pushes won't require token entry

## Option 4: Use SSH instead of HTTPS (best for developers)

1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Add SSH key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Change remote URL to SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SulaimanConain/yn-analytics.git`
4. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`

Note: The token you shared publicly has likely been automatically revoked by GitHub. You'll need to generate a new token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
